# Pattern Selection

Patterns are vocabulary for recurring problems, not mandatory architecture.
Rust often replaces classic patterns with enums, traits, closures, ownership,
and iterators.

Use a pattern only when it reduces coupling or makes an invariant clearer. Do
not introduce a pattern to anticipate an unconfirmed future requirement.

The target project prioritizes:

- builder and typestate for validated construction;
- newtypes for domain-safe identifiers and units;
- state machines for lifecycle transitions;
- command and event messages for decoupled systems;
- adapters and facades around platform or renderer boundaries.

The Rust Patterns catalog emphasizes the same principle through YAGNI: avoid
complexity when a language feature already solves the problem.
