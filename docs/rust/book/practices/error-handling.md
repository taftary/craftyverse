# Error Handling

## Summary

Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable failures and `Option<T>` for an expected
absence. Add context at subsystem boundaries while preserving the underlying
cause for diagnostics.

## Key points

- Engine errors describe resource, device, validation, and lifecycle failures.
- Game errors describe content and state-transition failures.
- Tools errors identify invalid input paths, formats, and reproducibility failures.
- `panic!` is reserved for violated internal invariants or unrecoverable startup conditions.
- Library APIs expose meaningful typed errors; application code attaches context.

## Boundary policy

- Engine errors describe resource, device, validation, and lifecycle failures.
- Game errors describe content and state-transition failures.
- Tools errors identify invalid input paths, formats, and reproducibility failures.
- `panic!` is reserved for violated internal invariants or unrecoverable startup conditions.

Choose an error crate only after the workspace's library/application boundary is
clear. Library APIs should expose meaningful typed errors; application code may
attach context and decide how to report or terminate.
