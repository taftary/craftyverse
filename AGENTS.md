## Project overview

PlanetCrafter is a high-performance game built from scratch in **Rust**, using
**Vulkan** as the sole graphics API. The current baseline is desktop Vulkan
(validated on Windows and Linux CI runners); Android (native Vulkan) and iOS
(Vulkan via MoltenVK) are **Planned**, not implemented - no mobile target,
build, or CI validation exists yet (`docs/book/architecture/technology.md`).
The project is at an early stage: it currently contains the geometric node
system (hierarchical triangle subdivision with directional vectors and
bidirectional links) and a Vulkan debug viewer to visualize it.

## Workspace layout

Cargo workspace (edition 2024, resolver 3) defined in the root `Cargo.toml`:

- `crates/engine` - library `planet-crafter-engine`. Reusable geometry,
  topology, scene data, text, and the Vulkan viewer. Source modules: `node`,
  `scene`, `text`, `render`.
- `crates/game` - binary `planet-crafter` (the default workspace member).
  Application entry point and content policy.
- `crates/tools` - asset/developer tooling. Not a default workspace member.
- `docs/examples` - package `planet-crafter-examples`. Compile-tested
  documentation examples; the `viewer` example is gated behind the `gpu`
  feature.
- `tests/` - package `planet-crafter-tests`. Consolidated engine and game
  test suite, organized by engine module (see "Testing layout").
- `assets/fonts` - bundled JetBrains Mono (SIL OFL), embedded via
  `include_bytes!`.
- `docs/` - mdBook architecture book (`docs/book`, the target blueprint),
  module specifications (`docs/book/specs`), and validation scripts
  (`docs/scripts`).

Shaders are not files: GLSL `#version 450` sources are `pub(crate) const &str`
literals in `crates/engine/src/render/shaders.rs`, compiled to SPIR-V at
runtime by naga.

## Module specs and further reading

Before changing a module, read its specification and the relevant book pages:

- Module specs (current implementation): `docs/book/specs/` - one page per
  engine module area (`node`, `subdivision`, `icosphere`, `scene`, `text`,
  `render`); a module may grow focused subpages when a submodule owns a
  self-contained contract.
- Engineering practices: `docs/book/practices/` - project structure, error
  handling, testing, public APIs, dependencies, performance.
- Design principles: `docs/book/principles/` - ownership, safety, type-driven
  design, SOLID, and DRY.
- Patterns: `docs/book/patterns/` - adopt one only when a concrete problem
  justifies it; patterns must be validated before they become project APIs.

## Commands

Run the application (local only, not in CI):

```text
cargo run --bin planet-crafter                 # run the Vulkan viewer (debug)
cargo run --release --bin planet-crafter       # optimized build
```

Validation enforced by CI (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`):

```text
cargo fmt --check                              # formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets           # test suite + headless examples
cargo check --example viewer -p planet-crafter-examples --features gpu  # compile-check only
docs/scripts/check-book.sh                     # docs: mdBook build + link/section checks
```

Validation that is local only (not run by CI, still expected to pass):

```text
cargo test --doc --workspace                   # doc tests
cargo run --example viewer -p planet-crafter-examples --features gpu    # needs a Vulkan display
```

## Environment notes

- Rust toolchain: edition 2024, Rust 1.85+.
- Running the viewer requires a Vulkan-capable GPU and display. CI only
  compile-checks the GPU example; do not expect `cargo run --bin
  planet-crafter` to work on a headless machine.
- Windows: `.cargo/config.toml` raises the main-thread stack reserve to 16 MB.
  This is required by vulkano's runtime SPIR-V parser. Do not remove it.
- Test runs are headless; the `gpu`-gated `viewer` example is compile-checked
  separately (see "Testing layout").
- The mdBook version is pinned in `docs/.mdbook-version` and installed under
  `target/mdbook` by `docs/scripts/check-book.sh`. The first docs build may
  take a few minutes.
- `docs/book-output/` (mdBook output) and `target/` are generated and
  gitignored - never edit them directly.

## Code conventions

- Rust naming: `snake_case` for functions and modules, `PascalCase` for types,
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Keep public APIs documented: contracts, errors, ownership, and examples.
- Prefer small, named types over primitive values with implicit units.
- Visibility: prefer `pub(crate)` for internal collaboration; reserve `pub`
  for intentional crate boundaries and keep implementation modules private.
- Give each module one clear responsibility; do not create a generic utility
  module when a domain module owns the behavior.
- Error handling (target direction): `Result<T, E>` for recoverable failures,
  `Option<T>` for an expected absence, `panic!` only for violated internal
  invariants or unrecoverable startup. Existing render setup code still uses
  `unwrap` - treat typed errors as the direction, not the current state.
- `unsafe` code: safe Rust is the default. New `unsafe` is permitted only at
  platform/GPU boundaries, with a small scope and a documented safety
  invariant. The only existing blocks are in `crates/engine/src/render/`
  (the vulkano `draw` call, `ShaderModule::new`, and the `wait_idle` device
  wait before in-place vertex-buffer rewrites).
- Shared dependency versions are centralized in the root
  `[workspace.dependencies]` (e.g. `glam`); member crates reference them with
  `{ workspace = true }`.
- Dependency direction: the engine must not depend on game content or tools,
  and tools-only dependencies do not belong in runtime crates. `Cargo.lock`
  is committed - keep it in sync with manifest changes.
- The core dependencies are deliberate choices: `vulkano` (Vulkan bindings),
  `winit` (windowing), `naga` (GLSL to SPIR-V at runtime), `fontdue` (font
  rasterization), `glam` (math). Do not add new dependencies without a stated
  need.

## Testing layout

- All engine and game tests live in the workspace-root `tests/` package
  (`planet-crafter-tests`): one integration-test target per engine module
  (`node`, `scene`, `text`, `render`) plus one `game` target. Modules with
  submodules are folders that split the tests one file per submodule (for
  example `tests/node/subdivision.rs`); each folder's `main.rs` declares the
  files as modules of its test target.
- Test fixtures shared across targets live in `tests/src/fixtures.rs` (the
  package's small library target).
- Whitebox internals reach the tests through the engine's `test-internals`
  feature, which adds the `planet_crafter_engine::testing` re-export module
  plus feature-gated re-exports in each engine module. This is a test-only
  surface, not a public API contract: builds without the feature expose
  nothing extra.
- `docs/examples` keeps its own inline tests: those are compile-tested
  documentation examples, not application tests.
- Tests and examples that need a window, GPU, or device are gated behind the
  `gpu` feature via `required-features`, so headless runs skip them
  automatically.

## Documentation rules

- `docs/book` is the **target** architecture blueprint. Current implementation
  facts belong in source documentation, `docs/book/specs/`, and architecture
  decision records - do not mix current-state claims into the target blueprint.
- Status language: use only `Current baseline`, `Target`, `Planned`, and
  `Open`. Never describe a planned crate, dependency, platform, or workflow as
  implemented.
- Use ASCII prose punctuation in documentation (hyphens, not em dashes).
  Mathematical and technical notation (arrows, degree signs, set membership)
  and box-drawing characters in directory trees are exempt.
- Documentation changes must pass `docs/scripts/check-book.sh` (build, link
  check, required page sections). Examples in docs must be small enough to
  compile and review.
- When a change retires a document, record its replacement in
  `docs/RETIREMENT.md`. Follow `docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` for docs and
  architecture reviews, and `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for PR expectations.

## Definition of done

Before considering a change complete:

1. `cargo fmt --check` passes.
2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
   passes.
3. `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` and `cargo test --doc --workspace`
   pass.
4. If docs changed: `docs/scripts/check-book.sh` passes.
5. If a module's behavior changed: its spec in `docs/book/specs/` is still
   accurate.
6. If scene/viewer behavior changed: the viewer controls documented in
  `README.md` are still accurate.
7. If the change affects anything this file documents (commands, workspace
   layout, conventions): `AGENTS.md` is updated to match.
